# Defibrillator Waveform Simulation

## Aim

1.  To simulate the Defibrillator output waveform
2.  To understand energy levels generated by defibrillator
3.  To understand the necessity and applications of defibrillator
4.  To understand various controls associated with defibrillator
5.  To understand various configurations and types of defibrillator

## Pre Requisites

-   Knowledge of various cardiac arrhythmias
-   Tools like NI LabVIEW and MATLAB

## Theory

The instrument for administering the shock is called a defibrillator. Electric shock by defibrillator is used to reestablish normal activity. The shock can be delivered to the heart by means of electrode placed on chest of the patient.

Ventricular fibrillation is serious cardiac emergency resulting from asynchronous contraction of heart muscle. This uncoordinated movement of ventricle walls of the heart may result from electric shock or from abnormalities of body chemistry. Main problem of fibrillation is continuously stimulation of adjacent cells of heart muscle fibers.so there is no synchronized succession of events that follow heart action. This Fibrillation leads to loss of cardiac output and irreversible brain damage or death if not reversed within 5 minutes of onset.

-   Monophasic pulse width is typically programmable from 3.0 to 12.0 msec.
-   Biphasic positive pulse width is typically programmable from 3.0 to 10.0 msec, while the negative pulse is from 1.0 to 10.0 msec
-   Studies suggest that biphasic pulses yield increased defibrillation efficacy with respect to Monophasic pulses
