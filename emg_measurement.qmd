# Electromyogram (EMG) Measurement

## Aim

> Acquisition of EMG Signal with the help of nerve stimulation and Bio-pack Systems.

## Apparatus

-   EMG Stimulator

-   Ring electrodes and other hardware components

-   Biopac software

## Theory

> Electromyography records electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. The signal is determined by action potentials generated by muscle fibers during contraction and relaxation. EMG signals provide valuable information to diagnose neuromuscular disorders and study motor control. EMG results can reveal nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with nerve-to-muscle signal transmission. Motor neurons transmit electrical signals that cause muscles to contract. An EMG uses tiny devices called electrodes to translate these signals into graphs, sounds or numerical values that are then interpreted by a specialist.

## Nerve stimulator

-   The selector has two options, the EMG, and the stimulator. The EMG is used to record the EMG signal and the stimulator is used to generate stimulus in the body to obtain a signal.
-   To produce a stimulus, the stimulator is set to 100ms and the intensity is varied accordingly.
-   After selecting EMG in the selector region, the gain is set to 1 and is set on the EMG mode to enable the acquisition of the signal.
-   Two wires from this system are connected as input to the Ag/AgCl electrodes placed on the fingers.
-   Two wires are connected as output to the storage oscilloscope to record the EMG signal.

### Procedure

1.  The Ag/AgCl electrodes are placed on the index finger (+ve), ring finger (-ve) of the right hand and the reference electrode is placed on any finger on the left hand.
2.  The subject should not be wearing any metallic accessories on the hand since it creates noise while acquiring the signal.
3.  The fingers of both the hands are then contracted and relaxed until a spike is observed on the oscilloscope.
4.  The amplitude of the signal is calculated and then multiplied with 100 mV and the amplitude of the EMG signal is thus obtained.

## Bio-PAC system

Using the Bio-pack system, we acquire the EMG signal.

### Procedure

1.  Select icon BSL Lessons.
2.  Select EMG 1. Click Ok.
3.  Colour code is mentioned to connect the electrodes.
4.  Click Calibrate. The subject is asked to clench fist as hard as possible and then release.
5.  The subject also uses headphones to listen to the noise.
6.  Statistical parameters are measured and recorded.
7.  Minimum, maximum, peak-to-peak, mean, standard deviation is found and are plotted and recorded.

## Observation

### Nerve stimulator

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(gt)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  subject = c("Kulkarni sir", "Mayuri", "Namyatha", "Kushaal"),
  voltage = c(10, 6, 7, 7.1)
)

# Create a gt table
table <- data |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "EMG",
    subtitle = "Muscle contraction voltages for each subject"
  ) |> 
  cols_label(
    subject = "Subject",
    voltage = "Muscle contraction voltage (in Volts)"
  )

```

### Bio-PAC system

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(gt)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  hands = c("Left Hand_1", "Left Hand_2", "Right Hand_1", "Right Hand_2"),
  p2p = c(1.712, 1.589, 1.5011, 1.959),
  vmax = c(0.893, 0.672, 0.229, 0.86),
  freq = c(0.383, 1.586, 0.304, 0.06),
  mean = c(0.113, 0.105, 0.129, 0.114),
  stddev = c(0.150, 0.147, 0.116, 0.150)
)

# Create a gt table
table <- data |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "EMG Biopac analysis",
    subtitle = "Peak-to-Peak Values, Frequencies, Mean and Std Deviations"
  ) |> 
  cols_label(
    hands = "Hands of subjects",
    p2p = "Peak to Peak voltage (in mV)",
    vmax = "Vmax (in mV)",
    freq = "Vfreq (in Hz)",
    mean = "Mean (mV-s)",
    stddev = "Std. Dev (in mV)"
  )

## Analysis

The EMG signals are acquired from the above-mentioned approaches (Ring electrodes and Surface electrodes) The amplitude of signals for peak voltage and mean voltages are analyzed to identify various muscle conditions like Muscle weakness and neuro muscular abnormalities. This also helps us find out the subjects dominant and non-dominant hand by assessing the mean voltage of a particular interval.

\% Difference in mean of weakest and strongest clench can be found to find the dominant hand.

**Left hand:** $\frac{0.129 - 0.114}{0.129} * 100 = 11.62\%$

**Right hand:** $\frac{0.113 - 0.105}{0.113} * 100 = 7.079\%$

Thus, the subject's **Right hand** is the dominant hand from the above analysis.

## Result

The EMG signal is thus acquired and recorded.
