# EEG Waveform Simulation

## Aim

1.  To understand normal EEG pattern.
2.  To understand various abnormalities associated with EEG.
3.  To assist in studying sleep patterns.
4.  To assist in diagnosing mental disorders.

## Pre Requisites

-   Understanding of Central Nervous System
-   Tools like NI LabVIEW and MATLAB

## Theory

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a unique and valuable measure of the brain's electrical function. It is a graphic display of a difference in voltages from two sites of brain function recorded over time. Electroencephalography (EEG) involves the study of recording these electrical signals that are generated by the brain.

### 10-20 Electrode Positioning:

The 10-20 system avoids both eyeball placement and considers some constant distances by using specific anatomic landmarks from which the measurement would be made and then uses 10 or 20% of that specified distance as the electrode interval. The odd electrodes are on the left and the even ones on the right.

There are five major brain waves distinguished by their different frequency ranges. These frequency bands from low to high frequencies respectively are: delta (δ), theta (θ), alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ).
