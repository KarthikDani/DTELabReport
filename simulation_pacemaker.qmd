# Asynchronous and Synchronous Pacemaker Waveform Simulation

## Aim

1.  To simulate the pacemaker output waveform
2.  To understand various energy levels generated by pacemaker
3.  To understand the necessity and applications of pacemaker
4.  To understand various types and configurations of pacemaker
5.  To understand various controls associated with the pacemaker

## Pre Requisites

1.  Knowledge of cardiac arrhythmias
2.  Tools like NI LabVIEW and MATLAB

## Theory

A pacemaker is an electronic device that provides an electrical signal to make the heart beat when it's own, built-in pacemakers fail. The anatomical, built-in pacemakers provide what is called the "intrinsic" rhythm, and they can be disrupted by various conditions - ischemia for example, or by an MI. It is prosthetic device for the heart, first conceived in 1932 by Albert S. Hymen, an American cardiologist. In 1952 the pacemaker was used clinically by Paul M. Zoll as an external device.

Abnormality in cardiac normal rhythm is called cardiac arrhythmia. There are various types of cardiac disorder. Some of them are Bradycardia and tachycardia. In bradycardia heart rate goes down from normal rate (i.e. below 60) and in tachycardia heart rate is higher than normal rate.
