# Blood Pressure Measurements

## Aim:

> To determine the blood pressure of the subject using mechanical and electronic BP meters.

## Apparatus:

> Sphygmomanometer, sthethoscope, and a digital BP monitor.

## Theory:

### Sphygmomanometer

> Sphygmomanometer is a medical device used to measure blood pressure. It typically consists of an inflatable cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm, a measuring unit (mercury) and a mechanism for inflating the cuff, usually a bulb and a valve.

### Digital BP Monitor

> A digital blood pressure (BP) monitor is an electronic device designed to measure blood pressure and heart rate. It automates the process of inflating the cuff, measuring the blood pressure, and displaying the results, making it easier to use compared to traditional manual sphygmomanometers.

## Procedure

### Sphygmomanometer

-   Subject is made to sit parallel to the mercury level of the monitor. The mercury knob is made opened.

-   Rough side of the cuff is placed on top of the left hand and is tied tightly on the brachial artery (point on left hand, where pulse is felt).

-   Stethoscope is placed on brachial artery just below the cuff's sensor to record Korotkoff's sounds (Heard when medical personnel listen for when they are taking blood pressure using a non invasive procedure).

-   The pressure is increased till 180mmHg using rubber bulb or inflator.

#### Note

-   Onset point of Korotkoff sound is the Systolic pressure

-   Dying of the Korotkoff sound is Diastolic pressure

> and the readings are taken accordingly.

### Digital Blood Pressure Monitor

> Digital sphygmomanometers are automated, providing blood pressure reading without needing someone to operate the cuff or listen to the blood flow.

## Calculations

$$
MAP = \frac{1}{3} (SP - DP) + DP
$$

where $MAP$ is Mean Arterial Pressure

Sphygmomanometer

:   $$
    \frac{1}{3} (120 - 80) + 80 = 93.33
    $$

Digital BP meter

:   $$
    \frac{1}{3} (117 - 85) + 85 = 95.66
    $$

## Analysis

-   We observe that there is a change in `MAP` with change in BP levels.

-   Generally, if there's a difference between systolic and diastolic pressure is `40 mmHg`, the subject is considered to be normal.

-   If the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure ranges between `30 - 50 mmHg`, the subject is considered to be `normal` depending on the conditions.

-   If systolic and diastolic pressure difference is $<30mmHg$, the subject has low BP which leads to hypotension.

-   If difference is $>50mmHg$, the subject has high BP which leads to hypertension.

## Result

> The working and analysis of mechanical and electronic BP meters are analyzed.
