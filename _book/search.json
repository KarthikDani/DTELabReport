    "text": "2.3 Theory:\n\n2.3.1 Sphygmomanometer\n\nSphygmomanometer is a medical device used to measure blood pressure. It typically consists of an inflatable cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm, a measuring unit (mercury) and a mechanism for inflating the cuff, usually a bulb and a valve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Digital BP Monitor\n\nA digital blood pressure (BP) monitor is an electronic device designed to measure blood pressure and heart rate. It automates the process of inflating the cuff, measuring the blood pressure, and displaying the results, making it easier to use compared to traditional manual sphygmomanometers.",

The mercury knob is made opened.\nRough side of the cuff is placed on top of the left hand and is tied tightly on the brachial artery (point on left hand, where pulse is felt).\nStethoscope is placed on brachial artery just below the cuff’s sensor to record Korotkoff’s sounds (Heard when medical personnel listen for when they are taking blood pressure using a non invasive procedure).\nThe pressure is increased till 180mmHg using rubber bulb or inflator.\n\n\n2.4.1.1 Note\n\nOnset point of Korotkoff sound is the Systolic pressure\nDying of the Korotkoff sound is Diastolic pressure\n\n\nand the readings are taken accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Digital Blood Pressure Monitor\n\nDigital sphygmomanometers are automated, providing blood pressure reading without needing someone to operate the cuff or listen to the blood flow.",
