## Theory

### EEG Electrode Placement

![](images/clipboard-1080795871.png){width="541"}

-   Electrodes are typically placed on the scalp according to the International 10-20 system, which standardizes positions based on the relative distances between key points on the head.
-   Each electrode location is labeled with a combination of a letter and a number (e.g., F3, P4), where the letter indicates the brain region (e.g., F for frontal, P for parietal) and the number indicates the hemisphere and position.

### Frequency bands of EEG

-   Delta - $\delta$ (0.5-4 Hz): Associated with deep sleep.
-   Theta - $\theta$ (4-8 Hz): Related to light sleep, relaxation, and drowsiness.
-   Alpha - $\alpha$ (8-13 Hz): Linked to relaxed wakefulness, often seen when eyes are closed.
-   Beta - $\beta$ (13-30 Hz): Associated with active thinking, focus, and problem-solving.
-   Gamma - $\gamma$ (30-100 Hz): Related to high-level information processing and cognitive functioning.

## Using Bio-PAC 

### Procedure for Bio-PAC

1.  

-   Active Electrode (A1) \[Red wire\]: Place this electrode on the Forehead Right.
-   Reference Electrode (R) \[Black wire\]: Place this electrode on the mastoid bone behind the ear or on an earlobe.
-   Ground Electrode (G) \[White wire\]: Place this electrode on the Forehead Left.

2.  To ensure calibration of electrodes, go to `Bio-PAC` \> `Lesson3` \> `channel 1` and select `EEG1`. Specify the channels associated with electrodes then click on `calibrate`.

3.  Now position the subject away from computer, ask to close their eyes and relax. Then carry out recording and saving for each subject acquisition data then copy and paste in excel.

### Observation

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(gt)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  subjects = c("Subject 1", "Subject 2"),
  p2p = c(19.302284, 25.17906),
  delta = c(1.0947, -47.723),
  deltaT = c(28.505, 24.745),
  freq = c(0.037729, 0.0404),
  mean = c(NA, 10.111183),
  stddev = c(NA, 5.62537),
  samples = c(8975, 8761)
)

# Create a gt table
table <- data |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "EEG analysis",
    subtitle = "Statistical analysis of EEG Data from different subjects"
  ) |> 
  cols_label(
    subjects = "Subject ID",
    p2p = "Peak to Peak (in micro volts)",
    delta = "Delta",
    deltaT = "Delta T",
    freq = "Frequency f (in Hz)",
    mean = "Mean",
    stddev = "Std. Dev",
    samples = "Samples"
  )

# Display the table

```
## Using ENOBIO
### Procedure for ENOBIO

1.  Open the NIC 2 application
2.  Select appropriate protocol or create one. Drag and drop the channel names into the right side bar.
3.  Ensure all the electrodes are properly touching the skull
4.  Calibrate and start recording. Use `.easy` file for analysis in Python.

### Observation

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Read and preprocess the .easy file
file_path = '/Users/karthik/Desktop/Raw EEG Analysis/20240702153206_JEEVAN 1_Protocol 1.easy'
column_names = [f'Channel_{i+1}' for i in range(8)] + ['Unused_1', 
'Unused_2', 'Unused_3', 'Unused_4', 'Timestamp']

eeg_data = pd.read_csv(file_path, delim_whitespace=True, header=None, 
names=column_names)

# Extract only the EEG channels and the timestamp
eeg_channels = eeg_data[column_names[:8]]
timestamps = eeg_data['Timestamp']

# Normalize the data
eeg_channels_normalized = (eeg_channels - eeg_channels.mean()) / eeg_channels.std()

plt.figure(figsize=(18, 12))
for i, channel in enumerate(eeg_channels_normalized.columns):
    plt.subplot(8, 1, i + 1)
    sns.lineplot(x=timestamps, y=eeg_channels_normalized[channel])
    plt.title(channel)
    plt.xlabel('Timestamp')
    plt.ylabel('Normalized Amplitude')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
Plot for Waveforms of `channel_1` to `channel_8`
```{python}
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import welch

statistics = eeg_channels.describe()

print("Basic Statistics for each channel:")
print(statistics)

# Plot the power spectral density (PSD) for each channel
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 12))
for i, channel in enumerate(eeg_channels.columns):
    plt.subplot(8, 1, i + 1)
    freqs, psd = welch(eeg_channels[channel], fs=500)
    sns.lineplot(x=freqs, y=psd)
    plt.title(f'PSD - {channel}')
    plt.xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
    plt.ylabel('Power/Frequency (dB/Hz)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
Power Spectral Density graph for each of the channels.

## Analysis

The EEG Signals are acquired from the above mentioned readings. We recorded the raw EEG while the subject was relaxed with eyes closed. For EEG recording with MP35 system, it was important to position the subject away from the computer and to place MP35 away from the computer (set aside or clip to subject).

In the ENOBIO recording, the subject's Power spectrum showed most of the frequencies were around 10-15 Hz in majority of the channels. For `channel_8` some frequencies were found to be ~$50Hz$.

## Result

The EEG Signal is acquired, recorded and analysed for statistical parameters.
